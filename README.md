# Viper!
A python, object oriented library to generate web pages with just python! Viper uses Jinja2 as a backend to render source code for every instance of any module.

 ## How do I use this framework??
 Simple. Once Viper is out of the beta period, we will be making this a python library that you can `pip install`. Once we do that, all you have to do is import Viper, and use its classes to build your web page!

 ## I don't understand this library. Could I have a demo?
 Well, since you asked nicely, you can check out a demo flask server we have setup which returns a simple page rendered by Viper in the `example.py` file included in the repo.

 ## I want to suggest a feature or report a bug, or want to contact the devs!
Well, there's always GitHub Issues tab of the repo. Or you could contact me on discord (`Zylops#7878`), where I am most active. If I somehow don't respond, try `u/ZylopsYT` on reddit, `zainaazeez787@gmail.com`, or @ZylopsYT on twitter.
